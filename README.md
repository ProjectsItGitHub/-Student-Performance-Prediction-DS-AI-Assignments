📘 Project Overview

This repository contains my assignments and project progress from Week 1 to Week 8 of the Data Science – AI (Practical, Project-Oriented Course).
The selected project is Student Performance Prediction, which focuses on analyzing student data, identifying key factors influencing performance, and predicting academic outcomes using Machine Learning models.

🧩 Objectives

Collect, clean, visualize, and analyze student performance data.

Build predictive ML models (Regression & Classification).

Evaluate models using metrics like MAE, RMSE, Accuracy, F1-Score, and ROC AUC.

Apply unsupervised learning (K-Means Clustering).

Derive insights into how factors like parental education, gender, and test preparation influence student results.

🧠 Key Learnings

Practical application of Python, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, and Scikit-learn.

Understanding the end-to-end Data Science workflow.

Gained insights into data cleaning, visualization, feature selection, and model evaluation.

Improved ability to analyze and interpret educational data patterns.

🚀 Future Scope

Expand dataset with more student-related features (attendance, study time, socio-economic factors).

Apply Deep Learning models for advanced performance prediction.

Deploy using Flask/FastAPI for real-time student score forecasting.
